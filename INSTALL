0. Dependencies
---------------

  - A UNIX-like system. The following are known to work:

     * Any modern UNIX
     * Cygwin under Windows
     * OS X

  - Objective Caml (OCaml) version 3.10.2 or later.

    Try one of the following:

     a. Use a precompiled binary package for your operating system.

     b. Build it from the official source.

     c. Use GODI: http://godi.camlcity.org/godi/index.html

     d. On most modern Linux distributions, OCaml is already packaged.
        Here are the commands for some of the more popular Linux
        distributions:

          Debian and Ubuntu:
               apt-get install ocaml
          Redhat, Mandriva, and SuSE:
               yum install ocaml
          Gentoo:
               emerge ocaml
          Arch Linux:
               pacman install ocaml

   - Zenon. See instructions in zenon/INSTALL

   - Isabelle/TLA+. See instructions in TLA+/INSTALL


1. Installation
---------------

A standard 'configure' script is provided to generate a Makefile. Run
it as:

   % ./configure

This will install tlapm in the default local install directory on your
operating system, usually /usr/local. This directory is represented
by ${prefix}.

If you want to install it to a different location, such as ${HOME},
run 'configure' as follows:

    % ./configure --prefix=${HOME}

If you want to install it in-place, run:

    % ./configure --prefix=`pwd`

(Remember to add `pwd`/bin to your $PATH.)

If 'configure' completes successfully, then run:

    % make all install

This will build the PM, copy the binary 'tlapm' (or 'tlapm.exe') to
${prefix}/bin, and copy some program data to ${prefix}/share/tlaps.


2. Uninstallation
-----------------

To uninstall 'tlapm', run:

    % make uninstall

This will remove the 'tlapm' binary from ${prefix}/bin and any data
belonging to tlapm from ${prefix}/share/tlaps.
